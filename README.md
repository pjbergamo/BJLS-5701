Containing two archives:
1) “colour.csv”- raw reflectance data of bracts and flowers of the hummingbird-pollinated plant species included in the study

Each column contain the spectral reflectance of one individual. Column names in the format: “spcode_pet” for petal and “spcode_bract” for bract.

2) “flower_detectability.xlsx” - sheet containing colour contrast variables and corolla tube length. 
Instructions to interpret each column:
external_structure: if present, species possess bract (or bract-like structure)
structure: external (bract or bract-like); petal (with green leaves as background); versus (petal with bract or bract-like structure as background)
CCB: Chromatic colour contrast with the background
ACB: Achromatic colour contrast with the background
Hum/Bee denotes if calculated in the hummingbird visual system or bee visual system
Length: corolla tube length
